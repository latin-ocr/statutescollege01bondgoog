what is this but gratuity), or any other profit, directly or indi-
rectly, for voice or assent in elections &c., and the very title of
the act is “ Penalties” (not for contracting or promising but)
“ for taking reward for election‚” &c.; the second rs, “the taking

’ which is committed by way of contractor bargain, were certainly
framed in the Popish times, or at least before that statute of the
Quaen, by which many things arc declared simony‚ which in the
eye of the law were not so before. And therefore the Arch-
hishop Sl say again) most wisely and picusly, by his injunctions,
(which send you herewith exemplified under my seal Archiepis·
copal) endeavoured to bring up your practice to the standard of
the abovementioned statute, which expressly declares, that all
electore should take a corporal oath to make their electione and
nominations freely, without any reward, gift or thing, given or
taken for the same. How this excellent and necessary provision
came to be neglected and forgotten, or rather (l fear) supprest
and degraded into the weak attempt of an overhusy Warden, is
easy enough to conjecture, but ’tis not to be done without much
sad reflectiom which I have now no leisure for. Only, Icannot
omit to add my severe censure of the wicked and profane speech,
(whoever he was that said it) that if this obtained they must
resign to the Devil; which Ithe rather express my displeasure
against, because 1 have heard it thrice mentioned by several
persons of your Collega with seeming approbation, whether as an
, argument orapiece of wit, l know not. God‘Almighty preserve
ns from making a mock of sin, and deliver ns from every evil
worlt, and preserve us unto his heavenly kingdom. Iam, Sir,
your affectionate friend, ’
