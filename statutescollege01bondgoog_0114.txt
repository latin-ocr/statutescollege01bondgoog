but converted to amandmeut of diet, aod other necessary uses of
common charge. But do rather take it to be directly against the
intent of tha said statute, that you should divide any part of the
said corn or any money among yourselvas3 it being no other but
a fraudulent diverting of the same from the behoof and profit of
the Collega unto private uam, which is the ,point principally for·
bidden by tha statutas. Wherefora Ι do require you Mr. Warden,
and the rest, that no such divisione be made, but that you content
yourselves with a competent augmentation of diet, so as the com·
mon and necessary charges of your Housa may be supported as
heratofora they have been; and not, in respect of the Wardan’a
withstanding your demands in this kind, you deuy keeping of
courts and necessary dafence of your ri hts by law, in refusing to
give allowanca for that purpose, as Ihear ylou have lately done
in a cause of great importanctn whereat Ι muc marvel. And so Ι

commit you to God. At Lambeth, the 27ttr May, 1609.

two years continue the practica of the civil law, either of Doctor or

House, than 1 suppose was ever intended by my predecessor,I
have therefore thou
hereby to suspand tha said injunction, and tha force and execution
thereos against any of your said Fellows, until you shall receive
· further direction from me concerning tha same: and so commit

ἷὲιόθῐο the tuition of God. At Lambeth, the tud of March,

Your vary loving friend,

R. Canr.

' Forasmuch as your Gracc seemed willing to take my opinion

Arta, when his time ia coma, wherein the F cunder’s statutas ap-
pointeth him to be present, shall ba thereunto warned effectually‚
