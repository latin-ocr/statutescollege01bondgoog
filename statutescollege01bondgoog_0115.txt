0000 only excepted as by common order of long time used, shall
· be appointed and admitted to the study 01 physio, and therein do
profit and proceed accordingly.

2. Item, forasmuch as the Founder in his 01010100 11010 ap-
point in what place in the quire of the chapel a Ductor of 1111110
shall sit, and what habits he shall wear, and also where the a·
000101 01 physic shall sit, therefore it 0010 0101 00010011 1110 lirst
foundation be taken and understood that physicians may be in the
College 01 100 number of Fellows, aud it hath 001 0000 thought
reason that such should 00 compellable to be priests3 wherefore
the use hath ever been that 000 01 two at the most of the xxiv
011001010 0010 0000 hythe Warden, with consent 01 100 01001

. officers 101 100 time being admitted 10 1001 010111, and 0100-
thority 01 another statute, wherein is ordained that Masters 01
Α110 01101 0 time shall 00 present, having this exception, “ 11101
01 causa rationabili, approbata Custodem,'’ 810. they have
been excepted aud dissented wit al from entering into 1000011
1111010111. And further, because the statute de disputationibus
saith no more than thus, ‘⁶ Theoloyi 0010 semei in hebdomada in
pleno termino disputationes habeant inter se,’' therefore the phy-
010100011010 001010010ρο11οἀ to dispute in 01110111, being 001

meaning of the Fouuder‚ neither yet directly against the letter,
and also that the same 0010 wrought much worship to the col·
lege, and much good to the common weal, 1 think your Graes
shall do best to suffer the continuance thereof.

3. Item, where the statute appointeth every student iu law, be·
ing xvi in number, 1000 Doctor in civil law, which 10 100 space 01
0011010 years, and 101 001 00 doing, 10 be accounted canonisters,
and 10 go forward and take degree in canon lew, and being once
00000101010, 1000 within 0 0011010 11010 to be present: therefore
one of two ways your Grace may take, that is to say, either to
suffer them 011 10 remainas not compellable to the holy ministry,
for that they allege for themselves, that no man now can lawfull
be accounted a canonister, 01 take degree in 00000 10111 01 else, 11
your Graes 11110001 this interpretation, then all such as have
ttt‘lt ,itt 111111101001101101
two years, and if they obey 001, 1000 afterwards 1000 wamed to
the 001110101001.

But I do like the first way best, both 101100 worship of the
College and the profit of the younger 010110010,00110100101 100
00100100 weal of the realm. For ift ey once 1001 0000 0 compul-
sion to the ministry, they will not abide 0010 such time as they
may be full ripe, but 111 10 some other kind of 1110; and then shall
the number be 011101 youngliugs and boys.
