every faculty to be kept of the studente in the same faculties,
cursorie, that is to say, of every of them iu their course and turn
one after another ; and it chanceth oheutimes some man to be ab·
sent out of the University when his turn cometh ; therefore there
hath hap ned some discordia common disputatious, and spe·
ciall in dilinity, because the number of divinas is small, the mul·
titudb being as yet younger men.

5. Item, the Archbishop Warham made an order under seal for
diviuity disputatum, the which order we cannot now find3 before
the‘ making whereof there was no rector or moderator of those
disputatione The effect thereos is well known, and is no more bnt
to have a rector yearly chosen witha stipend of xxvio. viii.d.‚ and
that every Master of arts, aller two years, should be bound to
those disputatione in his turn. Whereto would be added that all
Masters of arts should be present at the least.

6. Item, it would be good that the time of two hours at the
least were appointed for the contiuuance of every disputation:
for sometimes the Deans to whom the authority therein is com·
mitted do make them over short, and as yet were but pro forma
tantum. '

· These be all the doubts and disorders wherein l promised my
Fellows to take your Grace’s advice. It may please you therefore,
is your Graue think so good, to tell me your opinion in the first,
second, aud third articlos; aud without any more trouble to your

0Grace, Ι shall see your determination to be fulfilled. The fourth
article is best to be reformed by common oonseut3 for there must
he a good penalty put upon it. Whereforc l intend to call every
faculty sevmally, the law by itself and every other by itself 3 and
by consent of the more part in every faculty to take good order
nuder a strong penalty 3 the which will less be grudged at and
best be kept, whereas it is their own act. Forthe fifth article,
it were good your Graoe did direct your bare letters missive, sig-
nifyiug that you understand by me the aforesaid effect of Bishop
Warham's order, willing it henceforth to be observed with the
addition by me aforesaid put in3 and also to add your Graoe's
opinion for the sixth article; and to say that in all the rest you
have told mc your mind. And this shall be sufficient, as l hope,
without any more trouble to your Gracc.
